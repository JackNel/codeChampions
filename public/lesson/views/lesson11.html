        <h3>Introduction</h3><p>Welcome, future Code Champion, to the exciting world of programming. Before we can embark on our adventure, there are some things you should know.</p>
        <p>We will be working in a language called JavaScript that is featured on many websites that you visit daily like Google, Facebook, Disney, and even this site!</p>
        <p>Like any language, JavaScript has rules. As we progress through the courses, you'll learn more of the rules, but there are a few you should know to start.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript likes to be told when you're done with a certain action. That's why we end lines of code with a semi-colon (;) to tell it to move on to the next thing. Think of it like putting a period at the end of a sentence when writing normally. Failure to put a semi-colon or putting the wrong punctuation can make your code go crazy and not work properly.</li>
          <li>Spelling and capitalization matter. If you want access to something you need to make sure it is spelled correctly and that all letters are properly capitalized based on how it was defined. If you incorrectly try to access something, you will get an error saying it is 'undefined'.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>JavaScript can be written in a text document or a special code editor like the one shown below that we'll be using on this site.</p>
        <div class="row"><div class="col-xs-2"></div><div class="col-xs-8"><figure><img src="../../images/codeEditor.png"><figcaption>Our shiny, wonderful Code Editor!</figcaption></figure></div><div class="col-xs-2"></div></div>
        <p>For our first exercise, we have provided the necessary code to familiarize you with the game interface. Simply hit run to move your character toward the prize!</p>
        <p>Have fun, and keep coding!</p>
