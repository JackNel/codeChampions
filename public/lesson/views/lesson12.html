        <h3>What's your function?</h3>
        <p>In our everyday lives, we run programs without even knowing it. For instance, you might have a certain way that you brush your teeth every day. Let's say you put toothpaste on your toothbrush, brush the top for one minute, brush the bottom for one minute, spit out the toothpaste, and finally rinse your mouth. You can think of that entire process as a function called brushTeeth (In JavaScript, we like to use something called camel-case where we capitalize all words after the first one).</p>
        <p>Just like you tell your body to run your brushTeeth function, you have to tell a computer exactly what you want it to do. Computers aren't as smart as people, though, so you have to be extremely specific when it comes both telling them what to do and what order to do it in. JavaScript will perform actions one line at a time in the order given.</p>
        <p>For our first exercise, we have written several functions for you. In order to call a function, you simply write the function's name and follow it with parentheses (). So your brushTeeth function could be called by saying <i>brushTeeth();</i>. This game, however, will be far more fun than just brushing your teeth. We are searching for buried treasure, and 'X' marks the spot! You can move your chacter in a given direction toward the 'X' by using any of our predefined functions 'moveLeft()', 'moveRight()', 'moveUp()', and 'moveDown()'. Simply enter the functions into the code editor and hit run to move your character toward the prize!</p>

        <p>Don't worry if you get stuck or forget one of the syntax rules, because we'll let you know either in the editor itself or underneath the game with an error notification.</p>
